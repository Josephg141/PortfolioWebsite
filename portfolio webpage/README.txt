# Portfolio Website

## Author
Joseph Gjelaj

## Overview
This is a personal portfolio website built entirely from scratch using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and a small amount of **JavaScript**. No frameworks or external libraries (such as React, Angular, or Bootstrap) were used in the creation of this project. Everything was hand-coded to showcase both creativity and technical skills.

## Features
- **Responsive Navigation Bar** with hover effects
- **Interactive About Me Section** with hover-reveal content
- **Contact Page** with styled contact links and icons
- **Project Showcase Section** (work in progress)
- **Custom CSS Styling** with consistent cream-themed color palette
- **Lightweight and Fast** — no unnecessary dependencies

## File Structure
- `index.html` – Homepage
- `aboutme.html` – About Me section

- `images/` – Folder containing background images and media assets
