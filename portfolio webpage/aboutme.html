                    <div class="hover-text">Growing up in Hamtramck, I spent much of my time playing sports and exploring new hobbies. Coding started as a fun pastime, something I experimented with in my free time while learning how computers and software worked. Over the years, what began as a hobby grew into a passion, as I discovered the creativity and problem-solving challenges programming offered. Balancing athletics and technology taught me discipline, perseverance, and how to approach challenges with focus and determination.</div>
